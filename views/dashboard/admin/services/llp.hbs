<h3>Limited Liability Partnership</h3>
<h6>Limited Liability Partnership is governed by the Limited Liability Partnership Act 2008. As the name suggests, gives a business the benefit of limited liability of a company and the flexibility of a partnership.  </h6>
<h4 >Benefits of Registering under Limited Liability Partnership</h4>
    <ul class="a">
        <li>1. The biggest advantage of LLP is that the partners of the LLP have limited liability, that means any partner is not liable to pay the debts of the company from their personal assets. </li>
        <li>2. Unlike forming a company, forming a LLP is an easy process and less time consuming with a minimum incorporating fees of Rs.500.</li>
        <li>3. Retirement, Insolvency or death of a partner does not affect the life of the LLP. It will get winded up only as per the provisions of the act. </li>
        <li>4. All decisions and management of the company are exercised by the directors of the company whereas shareholders receive very less power. </li>
        <li>5. In LLP there is no restriction upon admitting a partner into the company or leaving the firm or even transferring the ownership on others. </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div id="m2">
<h4>How to Register an LLP</h4>
<ul class="a">
    <li><b>Step 1: </b> Obtain a Digital Signature Certificate (DSC).</li>
    <p>Before registering, each designated partner of the proposed LLP must apply for digital signature because all the documents are needed to be submitted online. These Digital Signature Certificates are to be obtained by recognized government certifying agencies only. </p>
    <li><b>Step 2: </b>Obtain Director Identification Number (DIN) </li>
    <p>All the designated partners or those who are intending to be a designated partner are required to apply for a DIN, the application of which has to be made in the Form DIR-3. After attaching the scanned copy of documents (Aadhar and PAN) to the form, it shall be signed by a Company Secretary in full-time employment or by the MD/Director/CEO/CFO of the existing company. </p>
    <li><b>Step 3: </b>Application for a Name</li>
    <p>The registered name should be unique and should not clash with an existing company name. This could be verified on the MCA portal. The name should not match with any of the existing partnership firms, LLPs, trademarks or body corporates. </p>
    <li><b>Step 4: </b>Incorporation of LLP</li>
    <p>1. The form used for incorporation is FiLLiP(Form for incorporation of Limited Liability Partnership) which shall be filed with the Registrar who has a jurisdiction over the state in which the registered office of the LLP is situated. The form will be an integrated form.</p>
    <p>2.	Fees as per Annexure ‘A’ shall be paid.</p>
    <p>3.	This form also provides for applying for allotment of DPIN, if an individual who is to be appointed as a designated partner does not have a DPIN or DIN.</p>
    <p>4.	The application for allotment shall be allowed to be made by two individuals only.</p>
    <p>5.	The application for reservation may be made through FiLLiP too.</p>
<p>6.	If the name that is applied for is approved, then this approved and reserved name shall be filled as the proposed name of the LLP</p>
<li><b>Step 5: </b>Limited Liability Partnership Agreement</li>
<p>LLP agreement governs the mutual rights and duties amongst the partners and also between the LLP and its partners.</p>
<p>1. LLP agreement must be filed in form 3 online on MCA Portal.</p>
<p>2. Form 3 for LLP agreement has to be filed within 30 days of the date of incorporation.</p>
<p>3. The LLP Agreement has to be printed on Stamp Paper. The value of Stamp Paper is different for every state.</p>
